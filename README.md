# Epileptic-Seizure-classification-using-Machine-and-Deep-Learning-
This is a brief project on Classification of epileptic seizures using Deep learning algorithms such a CNN, LSTM, Ensemble learning of CNN+LSTM and Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision tree, ADA boosting, KNN, SVM on EEG data. For more accurate classification, DWT feature extraction is done on the dataset.
